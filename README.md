# Unreal Snake
Unreal Snake is part of my Unreal Arcade collection in which I try to recreate and extend popular arcade games in Unreal Engine for educational purposes.

Please note that you may clone this repository and view _my_ source code and blueprints, but you might not be able to compile the game successfully as the project depends on third-party assets that are excluded from this repository.
